28. Implement strStr()
Easy

Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of
needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask
during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is
consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2


Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
